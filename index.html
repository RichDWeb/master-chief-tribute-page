                <p class="mt-md" id="tribute-info">Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, more commonly known as Master
                    Chief, is a
                    SPARTAN-II
                    commando of the UNSC Naval Special Warfare Command. He is the protagonist and main character in both
                    the
                    Halo trilogy and Reclaimer Saga. With over thirty years of active duty service, he has become one of
                    the
                    most decorated war veterans in the United Nations Space Command, earning every known UNSC medal
                    except
                    the Prisoner of War Medallion. </p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p class="mt-xs">The personality of John is explored much more deeply in the books than the games. This
                    is in order that players can more easily project their own personalities onto John-117. </p>
                <p class="mt-sm">As a child, John strove to win at any situation, at all costs. This seems to have been
                    a part of his character even prior to his conscription to the SPARTAN Program, as he pushed himself
                    to win at any game he played, including chess, gravball or King of the Hill. As his career
                    progressed, he transformed his desire to achieve personal victory to a desire to achieve victory for
                    his squad and, by extension, humanity as a whole. John is tenacious to complete any mission at hand,
                    and often disregards his personal safety in order to win. Indeed, he has often emerged victorious
                    from situations many would consider impossible. Though even a Spartan is not devoid of fear, John
                    simply acknowledges it and puts it aside, while never openly showing it. He is not shy about
                    expressing caution, however, as shown in his first encounter with the Gravemind. John is generally
                    stoic and taciturn, but not devoid of a sense of humor. He often makes dry remarks about the
                    situation at hand, but this seems to be more frequent when interacting with Cortana than anyone
                    else, such as other Spartans. </p>
                <p class="mt-sm">John is also known as a man of his word and will strive to keep any promise he makes,
                    even at great
                    personal risk. As he was forced to leave Cortana behind on High Charity, John promised to come back
                    for her after dealing with the Prophet of Truth. Cortana chided him not to make a promise when he
                    knew he couldn't keep it. However, despite incredible odds, John did keep his promise, as he fought
                    his way through the Flood into High Charity to retrieve her. Upon finding her, Cortana was in a weak
                    and damaged state. Nearing rampancy, John-117 told her, "You know me. When I make a promiseâ€¦" to
                    which Cortana replied "You keep it." This encouragement gave her the strength to compose herself
                    after enduring the mental tortures of the Gravemind. John holds great personal respect for his
                    trainer and mentor Chief Petty Officer Mendez, as well as Dr. Halsey, who he considers a mother-like
                    figure. He appears to deny Halsey's claims about his extraordinary luck at several points in the
                    Halo Legends episode "The Package." </p>
