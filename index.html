                <p class="mt-md">Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, more commonly known as Master Chief, is a
                    SPARTAN-II
                    commando of the UNSC Naval Special Warfare Command. He is the protagonist and main character in both
                    the
                    Halo trilogy and Reclaimer Saga. With over thirty years of active duty service, he has become one of
                    the
                    most decorated war veterans in the United Nations Space Command, earning every known UNSC medal
                    except
                    the Prisoner of War Medallion. </p>

                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p class="mt-xs">John was born in 2511 and lived with his mother and father in Elysium city on the
                    colony world of Eridanus II. He attended the Elysium City Primary Education Facility Number 119. As
                    a child, John had brown hair, freckles, and a small gap between his front teeth. In a dream during
                    cryo-sleep aboard the UNSC Pillar of Autumn, John recalled that his mother "kind of smelled like
                    soap," and that she had "large eyes, a straight nose and full lips.</p>
                <p class="mt-sm">The would-be UNSC Marine Lieutenant Parisa was a childhood friend of John's who John
                    once saved from drowning at Lake Gusev; John thereafter promised to marry and protect her. Parisa's
                    father shot a photo of the two soon after that Parisa kept as a memento long after she thought John
                    had died. John was also friends with Ellie Bloom and Katrina during his childhood. Some nights,
                    John would lay in grass fields with the girls and the three of them would look up at the stars
                    together.</p>
